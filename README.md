# How to run?

This project consist of two parts, the `backend` and the `frontend`.

Please run `npm install` for initial run for both `backend` and `frontend`.

## Running `frontend`

`ng serve` in `./frontend`

The app is then accessible on `http://localhost:4200`

## Running `backend`

`node index.js` in `./backend`

# Remarks

I didn't manage dockerize the app before the 4 hours mark runs out.

Other than that, I tried to structure the codes so that it is 
as self explanatory as possible together with few inlines comments in the codes.
